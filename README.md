## 3.	Summary:
#### o	drawback of this webpage 
1.	filter options seems to be bit complicated, and expects the user to input accurate information and not misspell in the search box. For example for city “el cajon” is accepted but not if you spell it as “elcajon” or “El Cajon”.
#### o	two additional recommendations 
1.	not load the data at once but to limit to certain number. 
2.	Including user feedback to improve the search functionality.
